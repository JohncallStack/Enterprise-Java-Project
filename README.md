Simple Web Application Overview:

This web application, built using the Java Enterprise System (servlets, JavaBeans, JSP, HTML), pulls a list of customer names from a database. Authorization is required, which involves uploading an XML file containing an employeeâ€™s email and phone number. The system checks this information against a database, and once authorized, generates a customer list.

Key Features:
Database Integration: Data is stored and managed using a MySQL database hosted on a server.
XML Parsing: The uploaded XML file is parsed to extract the necessary employee details.
doPost and doGet Functions: These servlet methods are implemented to handle HTTP requests, enabling the application to process user inputs and respond dynamically.
Database Connection & Queries: A secure connection is established with the database, and SQL queries are executed to retrieve customer names.
JavaBeans for Data Storage: A JavaBean is used to store and manage the data retrieved from the database.
JSP for Display: JSP files dynamically display the customer list to the user.
